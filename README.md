# Farm Management Web Application

This repository contains the frontend implementation of a simple farm management web application. It's a single-page application (SPA) designed for managing farm animals.

## Features

- **Simple Authentication:** Implemented basic authentication using `SIMPLE-JWT` to demonstrate the security aspect of the application.
- **Animal Data Management:** Apart from listing animals, features for adding, editing, and removing animals have been incorporated. Each animal has a unique “Name” property.
- **Tailwind CSS:** To showcase proficiency in CSS and Tailwind, no UI frameworks like Ant Design or Material-UI were used. This decision was made to demonstrate my skills in using Tailwind and custom CSS.
- **Deployment:** The frontend is deployed on Netlify, showcasing the application in a production-like environment.

## Notes

- The `.env` file is included in the repository intentionally as this is only a test project.
- Additional time was invested in enhancing the application with features not initially requested in the task, such as animal data updating (editing) and simple authentication, to provide a more comprehensive demonstration of my capabilities.
- If required, I am prepared to add tests to the project to further demonstrate my proficiency in modern web application development practices.
